Lab 1 for CSCI 3501
Authors: David Chong and Hunter Welch

Efficiency can be calculated using shell sort estimate:
O(n*log(n^2)) > divide by 1000 for seconds > divide by 60 for mins > divide by 60 for hours > divide by 24 for days > divide by 365 for years

We input n! for n in each case to calculate the efficiency.

We estimate:
n=15 would take 6087.617 years
n=20 would take 2.607944882735Ã—10^10 years

Where we found the permute method.

Where we found our estimate for Big O calculation - We think we used shell sort:
